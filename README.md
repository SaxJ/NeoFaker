# Faker

NeoFaker is a PHP library that generates fake data for you. Whether you need to bootstrap your database, create good-looking XML documents, fill-in your persistence to stress test it, or anonymize data taken from a production service, NeoFaker is for you.

NeoFaker is a fork of `fzaninotto/faker`
Faker is heavily inspired by Perl's [Data::Faker](http://search.cpan.org/~jasonk/Data-Faker-0.07/), and by ruby's [Faker](https://rubygems.org/gems/faker).

NeoFaker requires PHP >= 7.0.0.
